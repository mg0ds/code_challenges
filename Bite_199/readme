Bite 199. Multiple inheritance (__mro__)  â˜†
Implement the following class structure: print(Child.__mro__):

(<class '__main__.Child'>,
 <class '__main__.Father'>,
 <class '__main__.Mother'>,
 <class '__main__.Person'>,
 <class 'object'>)
Each class has the following string representation:

person = Person()
dad = Father()
mom = Mother()
child = Child()

print(person)
print(dad)
print(mom)
print(child)
Output:

I am a person
I am a person and cool daddy
I am a person and awesome mom
I am the coolest kid
You should use inheritance here, so the I am a person substring should only occur in the Person base class.

Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
