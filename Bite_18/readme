Bite 18. Find the most common word  â˜†
Write a function that returns the most common (non stop)word in this Harry Potter text.

Make sure you convert to lowercase, strip out non-alphanumeric characters and stopwords. Your function should return a tuple of (most_common_word, frequency).

The template code already loads the Harry Potter text and list of stopwords in.
