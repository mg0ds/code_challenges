Bite 313. Alternative constructors  â˜†
In this Bite your are provided with a Domain class and a DomainException custom exception class.

You will add some validation to the current constructor to check if a valid domain name is passed in.

Next you will add a __str__ special method to represent the object (basically the name attribute) and you will write two classmethods to construct domains:

1. from a URL

2. from an email

Here you can see the code in action (also make sure you check out the tests):

>>> from constructors import Domain
>>> str(Domain('google.com'))
'google.com'
>>> str(Domain.parse_url("http://pybit.es"))
'pybit.es'
>>> domain = Domain.parse_email("julian@pybit.es")
>>> type(domain)
<class 'constructors.Domain'>
>>> str(domain)
'pybit.es'
Good luck and keep calm and code more Python!
