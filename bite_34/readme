Bite 34. Building a Karma app - implement the User class â˜†
This Bite is about implementing a User class that keeps track of karma points received (Bite idea came from our karmabot).

As it is an Advanced Bite we have you look at the tests to figure out the implementation, but we will say that the class uses 3 magic/special/dunder methods and 3 properties.

Good luck and have fun!
