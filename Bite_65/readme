Bite 65. Get all valid dictionary words for a draw of letters â˜†
This Bite focusses on the use of itertools. To that extend you complete get_possible_dict_words and _get_permutations_draw to get all valid dictionary words for a random draw of 7 letters.

This is fed into the tests that calculate the word with maximum value (work previously done for Bite 3) and there you go: you have a Scrabble cheat tool (Scrabble fans, pay attention or maybe skip this Bite!).

For example a draw of letters G, A, R, Y, T, E, V would give highest valued word GARVEY (13 points).
