Bite 160. 15-way Rock Paper Scissors  â˜†
In this Bite you are going to write a 15-way Rock Paper Scissors game (this challenge first appeared as part of our 100 Days of Code in Python course).

The way you read this graphic is if an arrow points from one item to another, that pointed-to item is defeated. For example:

Paper defeats rock (paper points to rock)
Devil defeats human (devil points to human)
It turns out to be error prone and generally very unfun to work this out from the graphic. So we created a csv score sheet representing these relationships.

Complete the get_winner function following the docstring. We recommend parsing it into a dictionary/mapping of players -> beats whom (key, value) pairs (helper function _create_defeat_mapping). This will make it easier to determine the winner given any pair of (player1, player2) pairs.

The tests (see TESTS tab) will verify valid input to get_winner, all Tie scenarios and (more interestingly) all 105 outcomes using the original RPS-15 speak.

Good luck and have fun!
